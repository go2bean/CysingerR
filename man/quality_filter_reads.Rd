\title{Quality Filter Reads at Q20 Threshold}
\usage{
quality_filter_reads(reads_df, min_quality = 20L, min_length = 75L)
}
\arguments{
\item{reads_df}{Data frame with at least \code{sequence} and \code{quality}
columns.}

\item{min_quality}{Integer. Minimum Phred quality score (default 20).}

\item{min_length}{Integer. Minimum read length after trimming (default 75).}
}
\value{
A list with:
  \describe{
    \item{reads}{Data frame of quality-filtered reads with trimmed sequences.}
    \item{stats}{Data frame with QC statistics: total reads, reads with low
      quality bases, trimmed but used reads, short reads discarded, very
      good reads (no low quality bases).}
  }
}
\description{
Filters reads by Phred quality score, trimming at the first
base below the quality threshold. Reads shorter than a minimum length
after trimming are removed. Replaces \code{filter_scores_Q20.pl}.
}
