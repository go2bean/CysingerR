\title{Combine Paired Forward and Reverse Reads}
\usage{
combine_paired_reads(fwd_alignments, rev_alignments, wt_length, wt_seq)
}
\arguments{
\item{fwd_alignments}{Data frame of forward read alignments (from
\code{\link{align_to_reference}}).}

\item{rev_alignments}{Data frame of reverse read alignments (from
\code{\link{align_to_reference}}).}

\item{wt_length}{Integer. Length of the wild-type nucleotide sequence.}

\item{wt_seq}{Character string. Wild-type nucleotide sequence.}
}
\value{
A list with:
  \describe{
    \item{combined}{Data frame of combined reads with columns: \code{read_id},
      \code{ref_start}, \code{ref_end}, \code{wt_aligned}, \code{read_aligned},
      \code{alignment_line}, \code{category} (overlap/no_overlap/fwd_only/rev_only).}
    \item{stats}{Data frame with summary counts.}
  }
}
\description{
Merges forward and reverse reads by read ID, handling
overlapping, non-overlapping, and subset cases. Replaces
\code{combine_all.pl}.
