\title{Cysinger: Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis Deep Sequencing Analysis and Visualization}
\description{
A comprehensive R package for analyzing deep sequencing data from cysteine scanning mutagenesis libraries. Ports and enhances the Perl pipeline from Najar et al. (Structure, 2017) and provides publication-quality visualization functions for mapping protein binding sites and conformational epitopes. Features include FASTQ processing, quality filtering, read demultiplexing, pairwise alignment, substitution analysis, cysteine frequency quantification, normalization, and rich ggplot2-based figures.
