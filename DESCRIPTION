Description: A comprehensive R package for analyzing deep sequencing data from
    cysteine scanning mutagenesis libraries. Ports and enhances the Perl pipeline
    from Najar et al. (Structure, 2017) and provides publication-quality
    visualization functions for mapping protein binding sites and conformational
    epitopes. Features include FASTQ processing, quality filtering, read
    demultiplexing, pairwise alignment, substitution analysis, cysteine
    frequency quantification, normalization, and rich ggplot2-based figures.
